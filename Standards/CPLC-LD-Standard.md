## Outline

The CPLC-LD is the Ladder Diagram version of the CPLC Language. The language is designed so that a CPLC-LD file in text appears as a Ladder Diagram. It will be implimented this way so that it is possible to design and run a ladder program without the use of a graphical editor.

The various contacts, coals, and other objects will be easily recognizable to users of other Ladder Diagram languages. CPLC-LD will include all of the objects described in the IEC 61131-3 as well as allow for user defined objects. User defined objects will be easily to make: if the form is not already taken by another standard object, users may define how their object will look (keyword and shape) as well, the various inputs and outputs, as well as the logical function of the block. The predefined objects that come standard with the language will be created in much the same way that a user would create their own objects.

The syntax will be robust and flexible where whitespace and connector elements can be used to align and make blocks more easily readable. The syntax will strive to maximize readability within the medium of text while still conforming to expectations of ladder diagram languages 

The language ultimately we be implimented so that newcomers to the field as well as experienced PLC programmers will be able to use it effectively without need for a graphical editor.
