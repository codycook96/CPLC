# CPLC
 
CPLC is an open source project that aims to make PLC development more accessible by:

+ Creating a readable text based PLC language that aligns with IEC 61131-3

+ Creating a C++ based interpreter and compiler for the language

+ Creating tools for running the interpreter and compiled files on common devices such as Arduino's and Raspberry Pi's

+ Creating a graphical application for creating PLC programs in the language

+ Creating conversions for industry PLC file types to the language when Terms and Conditions of owning entity allow

It is hoped that this project will make PLC development more accessible for all people: providing a simple way of writing and executing PLC logic on their own machines and on cheap devices. This is useful not only for the sake of industrial programming, but rather the simple logical structure of PLC programming. Particularly this could make a useful platform for teaching kids basic programming skills and allow them to start basic controls projects of their own for very little cost.
