## Mission

The PLC Project is an open source project aims to create a free, simple, and modular platform for anyone to be able to learn PLC program and develop their own PLC programs on a wide variety of hardware.  


## Goals

+ Creating a readable text based PLC language that aligns with IEC 61131-3 [[Language](#Defining-the-Language)]

+ Creating a C++ based interpreter and compiler for the language [[Interpreter](#Interpreter)] [[Compiler](#Compiler)]

+ Creating tools for running the language Raspberry Pi's and Arduino's [[Raspberry Pi](#Raspberry-Pi-Implimentation)] [[Arduino](#Arduino-Implimentation)]

+ Creating a graphical application for creating PLC programs in the language [[Application](#Application)]

+ Creating a converter compatible with industry PLC file types when Terms and Conditions allow [[Converter](#Converter)]
